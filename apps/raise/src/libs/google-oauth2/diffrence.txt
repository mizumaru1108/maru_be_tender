OAuth 2.0 client IDs: If your application is using OAuth 2.0 protocol,
then use OAuth client ID. OAuth is used to create the Access token, which in
turn is a unique identifier. However, the user needs to agree a consent.

Service Account : Google APIs such as the Prediction API and Google Cloud
Storage can act on behalf of your application without accessing user information.
In these situations your application needs to prove its own identity to the API,
but no user consent is necessary. Similarly, in enterprise scenarios, your
application can request delegated access to some resources. For these types of
server-to-server interactions you need a service account.
